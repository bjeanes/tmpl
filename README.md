tmpl
====

Just an ad hoc starting point for projects, with an emphasis on maintaining
code quality. Maybe.

Everything below the `tmpl/` directory is part of the template for new
projects. For example, the `tmpl/LICENSE` file doesn't provide the license for
this repository (that's at the root level), but instead a starting point for
other projects.
